GarbageCalendar
===============

GarbageCalendar for Android gives you a nice overview of the garbage collections in your street (currently only in Ghent).   
It also reminds you to put out the trash the night before a collection.

This app uses open data from [data.gent.be](http://data.gent.be/datasets/ivago-inzamelkalender-0).
